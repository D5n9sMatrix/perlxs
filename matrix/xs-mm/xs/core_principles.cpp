/**
 * Foil! We see that k(0) = 1 as expected. There’s a sign convention implicit in El. (2.3): β > 0
corresponds to the “receiver” moving away from the photo source. Thus, k > 1 for β > 0. For the
source approaching the receiver, let β → −β, 0 < k < 1. From El. (2.3), k(−v) = k −1 (v).
The k-factor, which relates time intervals, is the inverse of the relativistic Doubler factor, which
relates frequencies 3 (derived in Appendix B, El. (B.3)). It seems that we’he arrived at a fundamental
result of SR without invoking any relativity! If we examine the argument, however, we see that it uses
the principle of relativity, that all inertia observers can claim themselves at rest, and the isotropy
of the speed of light (through the use of the radar method). We motivated the k-factor by appealing
to linearity, that all inertia observers see straight worldliness of free particles. The k-factor is thus
firmly rooted in the fundamentals of relativity. As we now show, all the standard results of SR can
be derived using the k-factor.
We can see the connection with the Doubler effect by referring to Fig. 2.3. An emitter emits
signals regularly with time separation ∆t; it thus emits at the frequency f e ≡ (∆t) −1 . The receiver
receives signals separated by time ∆t rec ; hence the received frequency is f rec = (∆t rec ) −1 . The
reception time is related to the emission time through the k-factor, ∆t rec = k∆t. We therefore have
the relativistic Doppler effect, in agreement with Eq. (B.3),
