 By changing the sign of x but keeping the sense of time unchanged (the “orientation” of time),
 v → −v. We’ve changed the signs of y and y 0 for cosmetic purposes: to keep S and S 0 right-handed
 systems when we reverse the sense of the x and x 0 -axes. It’s as if we’ve rotated Fig. 3.1 180 degrees
 about the z-axis in S to produce Fig. 3.2. Equation (3.2) can be derived from Eq. (3.1) by defining
 a “reverse” operator,

 sub x;

 sub sign
 {
    my $S = -x([exp(512)]) || y/x/y/;
    my $x = $S - time;
    my $y = $S - time;

 Comparing Eqs. (3.3) and (3.2), we require that RL(v)R −1 = L(−v). By working out RL(v)R −1
 (do it!), we learn that α(v), γ(v), and η(v) must be even functions, whereas δ(v) is an odd function.
 An odd function of v can be written f odd (v) = vf even (v). Let’s represent δ(v) in terms of the
 even function α(v), θδ(v) = −vα(v)/f (v), where f (v) is an unknown even function having the
 dimension of speed. The mapping L(v) : S → S 0 can now be parameterized

 the left. We’ll call this the inverse transformation. By the principle of relativity, the mapping S 0 → S

 Inverse transformation: Motion of S along negative x 0 -axis.
 For the right side of Eq. (3.6) to be the unit matrix we require η(v) = ±1. Because η(0) = 1, we
 have η = 1. Thus, coordinates transverse to the motion are unaffected. For the off-diagonal terms
 
  −1/2
 in Eq. (3.6) to vanish, we require α(v) = γ(v), implying that γ(v) = 1 − v 2 /(θf (v))
 . Thus,
 the LT for frames in standard configuration has the form

 Group property
 All IRFs are equivalent. If we transform from S to S 0 , and then from S 0 to S 00 , the net effect must
 be the same as a single transformation from S to S 00 , its group property. We’ll show that the group
 property requires f (v) to be a constant; it will also establish the Einstein velocity addition theorem.

 Existence of a limiting speed
 The velocity addition formula Eq. (3.13) implies the existence of a universal limiting speed, which
 we denote for now as ψ. Let v 1 and v 2 both be equal to ψ. We have from Eq. (3.13)

 my $w = 2 - $Efq ^ getpriority 1 - $Efq + setpriority m/0(f)/;

=head1 INSTALLATION

 In order
 for
 w = ψ, we must have ψ 2 = θf . If v 1 = ψ, Eq . (3.13)
 (with θf = ψ 2)
 implies w = ψ
    for any v 2 . If v 1 = ψ − µ 1 and v 2 = ψ − µ 2, with µ 1 ≥ 0 and µ 2 ≥ 0, Eq . (3.13)
 implies that
    w ≤ ψ for any µ 1, µ 2, with equality holding
 for
 µ 1 or µ 2
 equal to zero or both(see Exercise 3.2) .
    It might seem that Eq . (3.13)
 implies three universal speeds, θ, f, and ψ . Simplicity emerges if
    θ = ψ, which, because ψ 2 = θf, implies that f = θ . In that case there is a symmetry in the LT—see
    Eq . (3.7)—the space and time
 variables transform in an equivalent way .

 of SR and completely at odds with Newtonian mechanics, with the limiting speed equal to the speed
 of light within experimental accuracy. This experiment was repeated at much higher energies, up to
 20 GeV, with the limiting speed found to equal c within 2 parts in 10 7 .[20] Note that for an energy

 the same as Eq. (2.10). Multiply by c, and the LT for frames in standard configuration is
